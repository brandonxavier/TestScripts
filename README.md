TestScripts
===========

Scripts From Live Server Used To Test CB-AppDevKit

These scripts were all current at the time they were
pulled from the server and are intended to be fairly
representative of the types and (programming) styles 
found at CB.  

Any modifications, if any, I've done to them have been 
for convenience ONLY - namely providing some default 
values for required settings so I don't have to type
something everytime.  And wrapping the init function
with "if (!!AppDevKit == false )" - which is now
deprecated.

Feel free to add any scripts here you feel would be
useful in testing the ADK - remember, all the scripts
on CB are open source so freely copyable (having said
that, if you are an author of a script here and would
prefer it not be here, let me know and I'll happily
remove it)
